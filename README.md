# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Interpreting User Needs Through User Stories

In Agile development, I interpret user needs by collaborating with stakeholders and translating their requirements into user stories that clearly express value from the user’s perspective. User stories help define what the user wants, why they want it, and how success will be measured through acceptance criteria. This approach ensures development remains user-focused and allows the team to deliver working software incrementally while adapting to feedback.

Agile Approach to Program Development

I approach program development using an iterative and incremental Agile mindset. By working in short sprints, I can deliver small, functional pieces of software, gather feedback, and adjust priorities as needed. Scrum practices such as sprint planning, backlog refinement, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives help maintain transparency, encourage continuous improvement, and ensure the team is always aligned on sprint goals and product direction.

Being an Effective Scrum Team Member

Being a strong team member in a Scrum environment means embracing collaboration, accountability, and open communication. I contribute by actively participating in Scrum events, keeping my work transparent, and addressing blockers early. Supporting team goals, being open to feedback, and continuously improving both technical and teamwork skills are essential to delivering high-quality software in an Agile environment.
