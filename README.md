# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Interpreting User Needs and User Stories

I interpret user needs by identifying what the user is trying to accomplish and translating those goals into clear, actionable requirements. Creating user stories helps by framing features from the user’s perspective and keeping development focused on delivering value rather than just completing technical tasks. User stories also make it easier to prioritize work, define acceptance criteria, and verify that each feature meets user expectations.

My Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Practices

I approach program development iteratively by building small, functional increments and refining them based on feedback. I plan to continue using Agile and Scrum practices such as sprint planning, backlog refinement, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. These processes help manage changing requirements, encourage continuous improvement, and keep development aligned with project goals.

Being a Good Team Member in Software Development

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, taking responsibility for assigned work, and supporting the overall goals of the team. It also involves being open to feedback, collaborating effectively, and addressing issues early to avoid delays. Consistent participation and a willingness to improve both individually and as a team contribute to successful software development.
